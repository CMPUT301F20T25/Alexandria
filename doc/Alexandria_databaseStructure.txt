NOTE: I'm not sure what happens when you delete a document that is being referenced somewhere else so that will have to be handled when deleting stuff

NOTE: For intially populating the database and testing I've made two users (testUser1, testUser2) who each own a book (1234567890123-testUser1, 9876543210987-testUser2).
